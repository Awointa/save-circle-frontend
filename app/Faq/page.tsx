              <p className="text-gray-600">
                The insurance pool is a safety mechanism designed to protect members if someone defaults on their contributions. 
                Each participant contributes <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-600">1% of their contribution</span> into this pool at the start of each  savings cycle.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">How does the Insurance Pool work?</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-600">
                <li>When a member misses payments or drops out, the insurance pool automatically covers part of the shortfall so the payout can still be fairly distributed.</li>
                <li>
                  If nobody defaults during the entire cycle, the pool is considered "unused." In this case, 
                  <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-600"> 20% of the pool is taken as a maintenance fee</span> for sustaining the protocol, 
                  and the remaining 80% will be  reallocated and distributed back to the members.

                It reduces the risk of loss for committed members and ensures the savings circle can continue smoothly even if one or more participants fail to meet their obligations. 
                Essentially, it builds trust by offering a financial cushion against unexpected defaults.

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                The penalty pool is a system where users who miss contributions, pay late, or withdraw early are penalized. 
                These penalties are deducted from their locked balance and pooled together.

              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-600">
                <li>If you default (miss your turn to contribute), a portion of your locked funds is taken as a penalty.</li>
                <li>These penalties accumulate into the penalty pool and can be redistributed among compliant members or reserved by the system.</li>
                <li>This discourages careless behavior and ensures fairness for those who stick to the rules.</li>

                <li><span className="font-semibold text-amber-600">Insurance Pool</span> = proactive safety net funded by everyone (1% contribution) to protect against defaults.</li>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Why is the Penalty Pool important?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                It encourages discipline and accountability within the circle. By knowing that late or missed payments come with financial consequences, 
                members are more likely to stay committed.
